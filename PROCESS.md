- Problem: no dashboard existed for project/task orchestration and approvals.
- Resolution: implemented a static GitHub Pages-compatible dashboard with project, task, approval, usage, and auth views.
- Prevention: extend the existing dashboard shell and API contract instead of rebuilding the control UI shape.

- Problem: the initial dashboard implementation was too informal for long-term maintenance, and the first remote bootstrap pass accidentally synced `node_modules` and `dist`, creating unnecessary cleanup work.
- Resolution: migrated the dashboard to `React + TypeScript + Vite`, updated the Pages workflow to build `dist`, added `.gitignore`, and corrected the sync process to only upload source/config files.
- Prevention: new UI projects must begin as formal TS/React applications; before the first remote sync, confirm `.gitignore`, build output paths, and sync exclusions are correct.
